jMusic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
jMusic is a Java based music player which uses the GStreamer libraries for
playback of media.

Currently the it is able to playback any music files supported by GStreamer and
will load album art image files from the same location as the music.

In the future i'm looking to add some form of realtime communication to the
player and a way of syncronising playback of media between the linked players.
This would allow people to watch/listen to media and talk about it in real time
while experencing the same part of the media.
